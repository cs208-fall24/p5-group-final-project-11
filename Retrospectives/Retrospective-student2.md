## Experience

My experience with this project has been fantastic. My partner has been great to work with and I have learned a lot from him.
He was very patient with some things I didn't understand and offered great advice and guidance. Lance was also a great communicator 
in getting this project completed on time. The project itself was a great experience for me in that there were times when I struggled 
or where I didn't understand but I overcame the obstacles and learned a lot. What got me through was trying to focus on one thing at a 
time instead of the entire project as a whole. Once I got one thing working and working on it in small increments, then the project became 
much more enjoyable. I enjoyed this project and this class has piqued my interest in looking into more web development classes.
