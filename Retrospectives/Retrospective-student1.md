## Experience

I had a great time collaborating and conversing with Ibro, and my understanding of quite a few topics of uncertainty solidified. 
Despite the prior projects, I still felt unconfident with some database management developments. 
Additionally, although seemingly simple, I found the operations involving pushing, pulling, and whatnot confusing in 
practice. Searching online, there are quite a few varying opinions on the 'correct' way to combine different works
together. I tried keeping things as simple as possible, but I am still worried the way I went about all of the operations
involving GitHub may not have been appropriate. For example, we got some restrictions when we first attempted to pull each other's code. 
It claimed we did not have the authority. We found workarounds, but we need to determine why that issue occurred. 
Aside from GitHub, all went well. It was fun deciding a theme to go with and enacting a plan as a team - even if it was just the
two of us. We decided to keep the base color scheme of our website the same as BSU's. We wanted things to be different, 
so I deferred to ChatGPT to create a logo, It is awesomely displayed on our landing page. I added spotlights at the bottom for both of
us but opted not to post our headshots (to be honest, I was just lazy).
